      <h1>Kendall Furrow</h1>
      <p>My name is Kendall Furrow and I am a senior and will be graduating in May! I just finished up my senior season with Griz soccer and couldn't have asked for a better four years! My major is Media Arts and a business minor. I am currently apart of the Grizzly Athletic Marketing team here at the University and I have loved every second of it! I am looking forward to a new adventure after graduation!</p>
